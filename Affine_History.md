# Affine Cipher History

- The earliest it was mentioned Affine Cipher was in `1983`
- The affine cipher is a type of `monoalphabetic substitution cipher`, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.
- Affine Cipher is no longer in use as it is not as secure as it used to be. It can be easily cracked from brute force / guessing.
