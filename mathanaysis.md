 ## Mathematical Analysis
 Since, for the standard alphabet, there are 12 numbers less than 26 which are coprime to 26, 
 and for each of these there are 26 possibilities for the value of b, we have a total of 12 x 26 = 312 possible keys for the Affine Cipher.
 Each letter is encoded with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.
